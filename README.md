# 01-code-refactor

Received functioning code but needed to be refactured in order to meet standards as 
well as implementing accessibility needs. One of the first things that needed to be 
updated on the webpage was the title. A proper title is important because it lets 
customers know that they are at the right website for the Horiseon company. After
fixing the title, there was another discrepancy with one of the href links that was 
inside of the navigation section. 

Continued to adjust names within the sections of the html and added notes so that 
future developers will be able to identify different parts of the body with ease.
Lastly, added some alt's to corresponding images so that all patrons of the site 
can have access.
